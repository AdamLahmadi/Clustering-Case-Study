## Clustering in the Marketing Department

# Quick overview and Impact

One of the key pain points for marketers is to identify customer needs. By understanding the customer, marketers can launch a targeted marketing campaign that is tailored for specific needs. If data about customers is available, data science can be applied to perform market segmentation.

In this case study we will analyse extensive customer data and use K-Means clustering to divide customers into 4 distinctive groups to allow marketers to know their customers better.

The following customer clusters were created:

  - First Customers cluster (Transactors): Customers who pay least amount of interest charges and careful with their money, Cluster with lowest balance ($104) and cash advance (\$303), Percentage of full payment = 23%.

  - Second customers cluster (revolvers): Customers who use credit card as a loan (most lucrative sector): highest balance ($5000) and cash advance (~$5000), low purchase frequency, high cash advance frequency (0.5), high cash advance transactions (16) and low percentage of full payment (3%).

  - Third customer cluster (VIP/Prime): Customers with high credit limit $16K and highest percentage of full payment, target for increase credit limit and increase spending    habits.

  - Fourth customer cluster (low tenure): Customers with low tenure (7 years), low balance
